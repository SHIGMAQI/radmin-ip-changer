# Radmin IP Changer

A Python script to automate changing the IP address of the Radmin VPN client. This tool helps you quickly switch Radmin VPN IPs without manual configuration, making VPN management smoother and more efficient.

## Features

- Automatically change the IP address of Radmin VPN  
- Lightweight and easy to use Python script  
- Cross-platform compatibility (requires Python and Radmin VPN installed)  
- Useful for network administrators and power users  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Radmin VPN installed and running  

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHIGMAQI/radmin-ip-changer.git
   cd radmin-ip-changer



## Important Note
If the script does not work, it might be because your Radmin VPN registry key name is different. To fix this:

Open regedit (Windows Registry Editor)

Search for Radmin to find the exact registry key name used by your Radmin VPN installation

Open the RadminIpChanger.py script and update the registry key name accordingly in the code

This will allow the script to locate and modify the correct registry entry for your Radmin VPN IP.
